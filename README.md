# Neon Tic-tac-toe game - Vanilla JS

### Hyper Island  - "If this then that" module - aimed at getting familiar with Javascript

:briefcase: Brief was to make a game or a utility web application using vanilla Javascript, no libraries

It was among my first attempts at learning Javascript. Javascript code is based on a tutorial but with extra details added by me to get an idea how Javascript works. 

Neon design is made by me, attempt at deep-diving trying out CSS3
